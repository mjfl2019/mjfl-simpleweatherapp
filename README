Hi, many thanks for trying my simpleweather app!

NOTE: Please install first the XAMPP 8.1.10 for windows then import the included
file simpleweather.sql in phpmyadmin to run the program.

This app was built using Laravel PHP and intended to use when traveling
in the country of Japan.

The app is very simple yet powerful. It leverages from the power of AJAX
jQuery that asynchronously pulls the necessary API calls to OpenWeatherMap
and FourSquare Places APIs.

The design is very direct without any distractions or fancy animations.
You can find all nearby places and accurate weather information in just
a tap or click.

Please do email me below for any feedback and suggestions to help me
improve my simpleweatherapp.

Many thanks & GOD Bless!
